# Detailed Design for `accounts.py` Module

The `accounts.py` module is designed to manage user accounts for a trading simulation platform. This module provides functionality for creating accounts, managing funds, transacting shares, and calculating various financial statistics. The module will contain the following class and method signatures:

## Classes

### 1. `Account`

This is the primary class that will manage each user's account information, including their balance, transactions, and portfolio.

#### Method Signatures and Description

- **`__init__(self, user_id: str)`**
  - Initializes the Account with a `user_id`. Sets initial balance to 0 and creates empty records for transactions and holdings.

- **`create_account(self)`**
  - Initializes or resets account attributes including balance, holdings, and transactions.

- **`deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`**
  - Increases the account balance by the specified `amount`.

- **`withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`**
  - Decreases the account balance by the specified `amount` if sufficient funds are available. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

- **`buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: Callable[[str], float]) -> bool`**
  - Records the purchase of shares. Checks if the user has enough funds to buy the specified quantity at the current price. Updates holdings and transactions if successful.

- **`sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int, get_share_price: Callable[[str], float]) -> bool`**
  - Records the sale of shares. Checks if the user holds enough of the shares to sell the specified quantity. Updates holdings and transactions if successful.

- **`get_portfolio_value(self, get_share_price: Callable[[str], float]) -> float`**
  - Calculates the total value of the portfolio based on current share prices.

- **`calculate_profit_loss(self, get_share_price: Callable[[str], float]) -> float`**
  - Calculates the profit or loss from the initial deposit by taking the current portfolio value and adding the current account balance, then subtracting the total deposits.

- **`report_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`**
  - Returns a dictionary of current holdings with share symbols as keys and quantities as values.

- **`report_transactions(self) -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]]`**
  - Returns a list of all transactions including buy/sell operations with details on symbol, quantity, price, and transaction type.

- **`report_profit_loss(self, get_share_price: Callable[[str], float]) -> float`**
  - Provides the current profit or loss of the user by comparing the current net worth with the initial net worth (total deposits).

### Supporting Considerations

- **Helper Functions**
  - **`get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`**
    - External function to fetch the current price of a specific share. For testing, this will return fixed prices for predefined symbols such as AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.
    - Ensure that the `Account` class uses this function for any logic involving the current prices of shares.

### Notes

- **Data Types**
  - Use Python standard types such as `str`, `int`, `float`, `Dict`, and `List` for representing data.
  - Ensure that all financial calculations respect Python's floating-point precision requirements to avoid common pitfalls with floating-point arithmetic inaccuracies.

This design allows for modular and extensible account management functionalities, enabling further enhancements such as user authentication, multi-currency support, and connection to real-time financial data APIs in the future.
