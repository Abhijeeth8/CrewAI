# Detailed Design for the Account Management System

The `accounts.py` module is a self-contained Python module that provides functionality for managing user accounts in a trading simulation platform. Below is a detailed design of the class and methods that will be implemented in the module.

## Module: accounts.py

### Class: Account

The `Account` class will encapsulate all the functionalities required for managing user accounts and transactions related to trading.

#### Properties:

- `username`: `str` — the username associated with the account.
- `balance`: `float` — the current available cash balance in the account.
- `initial_deposit`: `float` — the initial amount deposited into the account.
- `holdings`: `dict` — a dictionary mapping stock symbols to the number of shares owned.
- `transactions`: `list` — a list of all transactions made by the user.

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float)`:
  - **Description**: Initializes a new account with a username and an initial deposit.
  
- `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`:
  - **Description**: Adds funds to the account balance.

- `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`:
  - **Description**: Attempts to withdraw funds from the account. Returns `True` if successful, `False` if the withdrawal would result in a negative balance.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`:
  - **Description**: Purchases a given quantity of shares if the account balance allows for it. Updates the holdings and records the transaction. Returns `True` if successful, `False` if insufficient funds.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`:
  - **Description**: Sells a given quantity of shares if the user has enough shares. Updates the holdings and records the transaction. Returns `True` if successful, `False` if not enough shares are owned.

- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`:
  - **Description**: Calculates and returns the total value of the user's portfolio based on the current share prices.

- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`:
  - **Description**: Calculates and returns the profit or loss based on the initial deposit and current portfolio balance.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`:
  - **Description**: Returns a dictionary of current holdings (stock symbols to shares owned).

- `get_transactions(self) -> list`:
  - **Description**: Returns a list of all transactions made by the user.

### External Function:

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`:
  - **Description**: This function is external to the `Account` class and is used to retrieve the current price of a given share symbol. For testing purposes, it returns fixed prices for specific symbols such as AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.

## Summary

The `accounts.py` module is designed to manage user accounts, allowing for deposits and withdrawals, buying and selling of shares, and tracking of transactions. It prevents illegal operations such as overdrafts or invalid transactions. The `Account` class provides methods for managing these operations effectively, ensuring a robust trading simulation environment.
